    "\n",
    "In Neural Networks, the heart of the Neural Networks is the unit called as Node or Neuron.\n",
    "A unit takes in one or more inputs, multiplies each input by a parameter (also called a weight), sums the weighted input’s values along with some bias value (typically 1), and then feeds the value into an activation function. This output is then sent forward to the other neurals deeper in the neural network (if they exist).\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedforward neural networks—also called multilayer perceptron—are the simplest artificial neural network used in any real-world setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "These hidden layers successively transform the feature values from the input layer to something that, once processed by the output layer, resembles the target class. Neural networks with many hidden layers (e.g., 10, 100, 1,000) are considered “deep” networks and their application is called deep learning."

    "# Keras\n",
    "Keras is a high-level library, using other libraries like TensorFlow and Theano as its “engine.” For us the advantage of Keras is that we can focus on network design and training, leaving the specifics of the tensor operations to the other libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks created using Keras code can be trained using both CPUs (i.e., on your laptop) and GPUs (i.e., on a specialized deep learning computer).\n",
    "In the real world with real data, it is highly advisable to train neural networks using GPUs; however, for the sake of learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just be aware that when we have larger networks and more training data, training using CPUs is significantly slower than training using GPUs. "
